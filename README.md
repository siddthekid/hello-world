# hello-world
My first coding project

Sidd here, I am an Engineer who has a bit of down time at work. Because of this, instead of wasting my time on reddit or YouTube, I have decided to learn how to code. I want to start with JavaScript and then move to Python. I am interested in guitar, music, and (recently) cryptocurrency. I also like tacos and your mom.
